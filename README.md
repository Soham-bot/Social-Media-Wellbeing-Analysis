📊 Social Media Usage & Student Well-Being Analysis

🔍 Business Problem Statement

With increasing social media consumption among students, there is growing concern regarding its impact on mental well-being and productivity. This project analyzes behavioral patterns and identifies risk-based student segments using machine learning techniques.

The objective is to:
	•	Measure impact of daily usage on well-being
	•	Classify students into behavioral segments
	•	Provide economic interpretation of findings

📚 Economic Concepts Applied

1️⃣ Demand-Supply Theory

Higher engagement increases demand for digital content but may reduce psychological well-being.

2️⃣ Revenue Optimization

Social media platforms maximize revenue via increased screen time and advertisements.

3️⃣ Risk Analysis

Heavy usage clusters represent behavioral risk segments that may require intervention.

4️⃣ Behavioral Economics

User engagement patterns influence decision-making and emotional responses.
