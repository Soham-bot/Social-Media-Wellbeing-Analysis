📊 Social Media Usage & Student Well-Being Analysis

🔍 Business Problem Statement

With increasing social media consumption among students, there is growing concern regarding its impact on mental well-being and productivity. This project analyzes behavioral patterns and identifies risk-based student segments using machine learning techniques.

The objective is to:
	•	Measure impact of daily usage on well-being
	•	Classify students into behavioral segments
	•	Provide economic interpretation of findings
